      "Golden Pothos, also known as Epipremnum aureum, is an amazing, easy-care houseplant that is both aesthetically pleasing and resilient. The attractive variegated leaves of the plant grow rapidly and are easy to care for, making it a popular choice for beginners. Its glossy leaves drape gracefully in looping trails making it perfect for hanging baskets, wall mount containers, and table displays. The plant is also known to reduce various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air that can be toxic, and can also help reduce snoring in bedrooms. Its natural resilience and ease of care makes the Golden Pothos a great choice for any plant lover, from beginner to advanced!",

      "Golden Pothos plants should be watered when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Depending on the temperature and light of the location where the pothos is placed, it should be watered anywhere from once every 5-7 days to once a week. A general rule of thumb is to give it a good, deep watering, allowing all the excess water to freely drain out the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil to dry out partially between waterings. Too much water can cause the roots of the plant to rot, while too little water can cause the foliage to turn brown.",

      "The golden pothos plant, also called Epipremnum aureum, is an evergreen vine that requires medium light, which means it needs to receive a few hours of direct sunlight each day. The golden pothos prefers its light to be indirect and bright. This can be achieved by providing the plant with early morning sunlight, which is the best source of light that maintains a healthy plant. When providing direct sun, the recommended amount of time should not exceed 4 to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n\nToo much direct sunlight can scorch the delicate leaves, so it is important to find the right balance of light for the golden pothos.",

    pruning_description:
      "Golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum) prefer little pruning and should only be pruned if parts of the plant are overly long or overgrown. The best time to prune golden pothos is in the spring. Pruning can be done in 2 ways. First, gently pinch off the end of the tips of the stems. This will help to promote bushiness and encourage the plant to branch out. Second, prune off any dead or damaged stems. Only remove a small amount of the stems at a time, since drastic pruning can shock the plant and slow down growth. Pruning should be kept to a minimum so that the plant can stay healthy and lush.",
